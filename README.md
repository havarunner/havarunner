# HavaRunner

[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/havarunner/havarunner.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/havarunner/havarunner)

## Features

* **Run tests in parallel by default**
 * Speed up development cycles with faster tests
* **Suites**
 * Group your tests by annotating them as `@PartOf` a suite
* **Scenarios**
 * Run the same test against multiple scenarios
* **Once instance per test**
 * Do your computation-intensive setup in the constructor of the test class
 * Write easy-to-reason-about test classes that rely on `final` instance fields
* **Non-blocking**
 * HavaRunner is built on Scala 2.10 futures, and it's run model is completely
   asynchronous
* **JUnit support**
 * HavaRunner is a JUnit runner, which means that it's fairly straightforward to
   adopt it in a codebase that already has JUnit tests

For an introduction, see the article [Write concurrent Java tests with HavaRunner](http://lauri.lehmijoki.net/en/nerd/write-concurrent-java-tests-with-havarunner.html).

## Install

Add the following fragment into the `<dependencies>` element of *pom.xml*:

````xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.havarunner</groupId>
  <artifactId>havarunner</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.4</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>junit</groupId>
  <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
  <version>4.11</version> <!-- Any JUnit above 4.10 should do. -->
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.guava</groupId>
  <artifactId>guava</artifactId>
  <version>14.0.1</version> <!-- HavaRunner needs the v.14 or higher. -->
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
````

HavaRunner lets you manage the JUnit and Guava dependencies. In addition
to these two libraries, HavaRunner depends *org.scala-lang:scala-library*.
Maven will automatically add that library into your classpath.

## Usage

### Hello world

Below, HavaRunner will run the two test cases in parallel.

````java
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.junit.Test;
import com.github.havarunner.HavaRunner;
import com.github.havarunner.annotation.AfterAll;

@RunWith(HavaRunner.class)
public class HelloWorldTest {

    final Object world;

    HelloWorldTest() {
        // You can do your setup in the constructor. Benefit from immutable objects!
        world = "hello";
    }

    @Test
    void HavaRunner_greets_the_world() {
        System.out.println("hello "+world);
    }

    @Test
    void HavaRunner_greets_the_galary() {
        System.out.println("hello galary");
    }

    @AfterAll
    void destroy() {
        // This method will be invoked after all the tests in the class
        System.out.println("Done");
    }
}
````

### Run the same test against multiple scenarios

HavaRunner lets you model your use cases with scenarios. Scenarios provide
a way to run the same test against each element of data in a set.

You can use scenarios by adding a static `@Scenarios` method and a constructor
that takes in one argument. HavaRunner will then call your test methods once
for each scenario â€“ in parallel, of course.

````java
@RunWith(HavaRunner.class)
public class LoginPageTest {

    final User user;
    final Object loginPage;

    LoginPageTest(User user) {
        this.user = user;
        loginPage = "here be html";
    }

    @Test
    void login_page_looks_the_same_for_all_users() {
        if (user == User.ADMIN) {
            assertNotNull(loginPage);
        } else if (user == User.ANONYMOUS) {
            assertNotNull(loginPage);
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unrecognised user " + user);
        }
    }

    enum User {
        ADMIN,
        ANONYMOUS
    }

    @Scenarios
    static Collection<User> users() {
        Collection<User> users = new ArrayList<>();
        Collections.addAll(users, User.values());
        return users;
    }
}
````

### Suites

Suites are a way to group tests and pass them shared data.

Suites are comprised of *suite members*. Tests declare their suite membership with
the `@PartOf` annotation. When instantiating the test class, HavaRunner will pass
the `suiteObject` to the test instance.

Because suites are instantiated only once, their constructors are an ideal place
to perform heavy setup logic, such as launching a web server.

````java
package your.app;

@RunWith(HavaRunner.class)
public class WebApplicationSuiteTest implements HavaRunnerSuite<WebServer> {

    final WebServer webServer;

    public WebApplicationSuiteTest() {
        this.webServer = new WebServer(); // Instantiate a heavy object
    }

    @Override
    public WebServer suiteObject() {
        return webServer;
    }

    @Override
    public void afterSuite() { // JVM calls this method in the shutdown hook
        webServer.shutDown();
    }
}
````

````java
// A suite member must be within the same package as the suite.
package your.app.rest;

@RunWith(HavaRunner.class)
@PartOf(WebApplicationSuiteTest.class)
public class RestTest {

    private final WebServer webServer;

    // HavaRunner will pass the suite object to the constructor
    RestTest(WebServer webServer) {
        this.webServer = webServer;
    }

    @Test
    void rest_api_responds_200() {
        assertEquals(200, webServer.httpStatus(""));
    }
}
````

#### Scenario tests in a suite

````java
@RunWith(HavaRunner.class)
@PartOf(WebApplicationSuiteTest.class)
public class RestForDifferentUsersTest {

    private final WebServer webServer;
    private final String user;

    // The first arg is the suite object, the second one is the scenario object.
    public RestForDifferentUsersTest(WebServer webServer, String user) {
        this.webServer = webServer;
        this.user = user;
    }

    @Test
    void users_receive_personal_response() {
        assertEquals(
            "<html><body><title>hello "+user+"</title></body></html>",
            webServer.htmlDocument("/", user)
        );
    }

    @Scenarios
    static ArrayList<String> users() {
        ArrayList<String> users = new ArrayList<>();
        users.add("Kalevi");
        users.add("Pasi");
        return users;
    }
}
````

### Enclosed tests

You can group tests by declaring them as static inner classes.

````java
@RunWith(HavaRunner.class)
public class EnclosedExampleTest {

    static class enclosed_example {
        @Test
        void using_static_classes_within_the_test_class_is_a_way_to_group_tests() {
        }
    }

    static class parent {
        @Test
        void you_can_use_inner_classes_recursively() {
            System.out.println("hello recursive example @ " + getClass().getSimpleName());
        }
        static class child {
            @Test
            void you_can_use_inner_classes_recursively() {
                System.out.println("hello recursive example @ " + getClass().getSimpleName());
            }
        }
    }
}
````

### Running tests sequentially

If your tests do not thrive in the concurrent world, you can instruct HavaRunner
to run them sequentially:

````java
@RunWith(HavaRunner.class)
@RunSequentially(because = "this test uses a backend that does not support parallel usage")
public class HelloWorldTest {
  // here be test code
}
````

Concurrency problems imply a [Code
Smell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell). If you see sequentially-run
HavaRunner tests in the codebase, try to understand why they cannot be run
concurrently. From this understanding you might gain valuable insights into the
architectural problems of the system.

Note that HavaRunner does not guarantee that the sequential tests are run in the order
they are defined in the class. This will become a problem to you, if your tests do
depend on each other. All in all, it is a good practice to write independent test cases.

#### Fine-tuning sequentiality

You can improve the speed of your test suite by running some of the tests
sequentially only with the tests of the same instance:

````java
@RunWith(HavaRunner.class)
@RunSequentially(
    because = "this test uses a backend that does not support parallel usage",
    with = TESTS_OF_SAME_INSTANCE
)
public class HelloWorldTest {
  // here be test code
}
````

The above config will instruct HavaRunner to synchronise only the tests that
share the same Java instance.

### Using the JUnit assumption API

````java
@RunWith(HavaRunner.class)
public class AssumeThatExample {
    boolean weHaveFlt = false;

    @Test
    void when_we_fare_the_galaxies() {
        org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue(weHaveFlt); // HavaRunner ignores this test, because the assumption does not hold
    }
}
````

### Full code examples

[Here](https://github.com/havarunner/havarunner/tree/master/src/test/java/com/github/havarunner/example)
you can find complete code examples.

## Running with Maven

It is a good idea to mention only the HavaRunner suites in Maven `pom.xml`. 
This approach has two remarkable benefits:

* HavaRunner will take care of running the tests in parallel. Consequently, 
  your tests will run faster on the Continuous Integration server such as Jenkins.
* Your `pom.xml` stays simpler. The `<include>` and `<exclude>` rules can quickly 
  become obscure. It's best to use them as little as possible.

Here is an example suite configuration for the Maven Failsafe plugin:

```xml
<plugin>
   <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
   <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
   <configuration>
       <includes>
           <include>**/WebDriverSuite.java</include>
       </includes>
       <skip>false</skip>
   </configuration>
   <executions>
       <execution>
           <id>integration-test</id>
           <goals>
               <goal>integration-test</goal>
           </goals>
       </execution>
       <execution>
           <id>verify</id>
           <goals>
               <goal>verify</goal>
           </goals>
       </execution>
   </executions>
</plugin>
```

## Principles of parsing

HavaRunner uses the term parsing to describe the process of discovering tests.

The principles of parsing are:

* Be eager: find the largest sensible set of tests
 * E.g., parse the declaring class, all the declared and super classes
* Let the more specific override the more abstract
 * E.g., if both the suite and the suite member contain the `@RunSequentially`
   annotation, honor the annotation of the suite member


## Controlling the amount of concurrently running tests

By default, HavaRunner will use `Runtime.getRuntime.availableProcessors()` to
control how many tests are executed concurrently.

As that can introduce problems in environments running multiple HavaRunner jobs
at same time, you can override the maximum number of parallel tests with the
system property `havarunner.maximum_parallelism`.

For example, `havarunner.maximum_parallelism=8` will instruct HavaRunner to use
at most 8 threads.

## Supported JUnit annotations

HavaRunner supports only a limited set of JUnit annotations. Here they are:

| Annotation | Semantics | Comment |
| ---------- | --------- | ------- |
| `@org.junit.Test` |Â Same as in JUnit |Â This fellow you already know. |
| `@org.junit.Ignore` |Â Same as in JUnit |Â This fellow you already know. |
| `@org.junit.Rule` |Â Same as in JUnit |Â HavaRunner supports only TestRules, not Method rules. |
| `@org.junit.Before` |Â Same as in JUnit |Â Supported only when the test is `@RunSequentially`. |
| `@org.junit.After` |Â Same as in JUnit |Â Supported only when the test is `@RunSequentially`. |

HavaRunner supports none of the other JUnit annotations.
